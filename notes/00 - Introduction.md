Computer science has some inherent limitations regardings its problems.
Some problems are really hard and require much computational power to solve them, while some others can't even be solved.
Some problems of interest are ubiquitous in our society and computers managed to quickly expand the range of problems which can be solved quickly.
However, many problems do not have their limitations based on how performant the computer is, but for a more intrinsic reason
